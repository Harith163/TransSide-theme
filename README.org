* My emacs theme(s)!!!
I've found most themes, especially dark themes have always come /close/ to what I've needed but for one reason or the other fallen short of my expectations. I'm working on my own theme(s) that are better. Once I feel like its kinda ready, I'll maybe? put it on melpa/elpa

* Things to work on.
** âœ”DONE Ideological things 
*** Learn color theory
*** Work on color consistency

** Mode supported
   + Org mode
   + NANO modeline
   + Company
   + Rainbow delimiters
   + Avy and Ace Window
   + Ivy and it's siblings (ish)

   + Mu4e Column Faces
   + Latex
     
* Trans-Side
  To use this theme, first clone this repo/copy this theme into a custom theme folder. Then add this line to your init.el file to tell emacs to add that folder to its path.

   #+begin_src elisp 
    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "path/to/your/custom/theme/folder")
   #+end_src

then load the theme by adding this.
   #+begin_src elisp
    (load-theme 'TransSide t)
   #+end_src

   If it doesn't work, consider installing autothemer from melpa first :/

   Thats it!
