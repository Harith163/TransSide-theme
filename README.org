* My emacs theme(s)!!!
I've found most themes, especially dark themes have always come /close/ to what I've needed but for one reason or the other fallen short of my expectations. I'm working on my own theme(s) that are better. Once I feel like its kinda ready, I'll maybe? put it on melpa/elpa

* Trans-Side
To use this theme, first clone this repo/copy this theme into a custom theme folder. Then add this line to your init.el file to tell emacs to add that folder to its path. 
   #+begin_src elisp 
    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "path/to/your/custom/theme/folder")
   #+end_src

then load the theme by adding this.
   #+begin_src elisp
    (load-theme 'trans-side t)
   #+end_src

Thats it!
