* My emacs theme(s)!!! 

I've found most themes, especially dark themes have always come /close/ to what I've needed but for one reason or the other fallen short of my expectations. I'm working on my own theme(s) that are better. 

[[file:screenshot.png][Org mode + my .bashrc]]

* Todo
  - Support for more font faces
  - Using contrast better to demarcate the important from the not.
  - Need to get a consistent color-scheme language so that similar things use similar colors.

* Trans-Side

To use this theme, first clone this repo/copy this theme into a custom theme folder. Then add this line to your init.el file to tell emacs to add that folder to its path. 
   #+begin_src elisp 
    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
   #+end_src

then load the theme by adding this.
   #+begin_src elisp
    (load-theme 'trans-side t)
   #+end_src

Thats it!
